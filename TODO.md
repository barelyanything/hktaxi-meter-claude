# TODO

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Print receipt** — Generate a PNG receipt image with fare breakdown (fare, extras, total, distance, duration, date/time)
- [ ] **Local storage for current ride** — Persist the current ride state (fare, distance, time) to localStorage so it survives page refreshes or accidental closes
- [ ] **Fare record** — Keep a history of completed rides with date, fare, extras, distance, and duration; viewable as a log/list
- [ ] **Taxi fare mode selector** — Switch between Urban (red), New Territories (green), and Lantau (blue) taxi fare structures, each with their own starting fare and per-increment rates
